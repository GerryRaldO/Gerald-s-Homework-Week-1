The point of the homework is to follow best practices in formatting for HTML and for CSS.
To that end I've edited the HTML extensively to look cleaner, and have proper headings.
I've added both the Header and Footer, instead of the DIV that was all encompassing, as well as the Main.
I've also added commits to the CSS file to better describe what is happening.
